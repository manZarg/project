            <!-- chocolate hills -->
            <p class="italic font-sm">Included in the UNESCO World Heritage Natural Monuments list, the Chocolate Hills of Bohol are a geomorphic wonder and truly a sight to behold. It is one of the best places in the Philippines to offer a unique landscape, with its 1,268 cone-shaped hills that turn chocolatey brown during the dry season, hence its name.</p>

            <p>Bohol has many interesting tourist attractions like the Chocolate Hills in Carmen, the tarsier sanctuary in Corella, and the Loboc River. The problem is, they’re spread out across the island so it can be a challenge to visit them on your own.

            The limestone hills vary in size but almost look similar in shape and range from 30 to 120 meters in height. It’s a must-add in any itinerary for Bohol trips.

            Make your way to the town of Carmen, where the Chocolate Hills Main Viewpoint can be found. 
            </p> <br>

            <!-- manmade forest -->
            <p>The manmade forest is a 2-kilometer stretch of mahogany trees that carpet the sloping ground where the municipality of Loboc meets Bilar. Travelers going to the Chocolate Hills from Loboc will not miss this.
                <br>
                We traipsed along the road under the canopy of a lush mahogany forest whose branches curved overhead. I could not help but look up; their leaves have blocked out the sun completely. Uniform and imposing, their thin trunks stand so close to each other like a platoon of giant soldiers. At the time, no wind was there to tousle their verdant tops yet they appeared to be moving, stepping back, giving way to visitors passing by. </p>

            <!-- dolphin watching -->
            <p>Like the Countryside Tour, dolphin watching and island hopping / snorkeling is another popular excursion in Bohol. You’ll set off at dawn to go dolphin and whale watching before spending a few hours snorkeling around Balicasag Island.
            <br>
            There you’ll come face to face with a spectrum of marine wildlife like fish, turtles, and giant clams. Check out my post on Dolphin Watching and Snorkeling at Balicasag Island for more pictures and information.
            <br>
            Like the countryside tour, we made our own arrangements for boat rental but you can book an island hopping tour with Klook or Kkday.</p>

            <p>Hinagdanan Cave is a cave in the municipality of Dauis on Panglao Island, in Bohol Province, in the Philippines. It is a naturally lighted cavern with a deep lagoon and many large stalactites and stalagmites. The cave is lit by sunlight which filters through holes in the ceiling. The underground lake is a popular swimming spot, but it has been known to test for high levels of various pollutants, since it is fed by ground runoff. Hinagdanan Cave is made of limestone. Its entrance is a hole about 1 metre in diameter, visible from a limestone hill. Cement steps lead to the interior. The cave is slippery, but there's a rope railing to hold on to. The cave is filled with sleeping birds in small holes in the ceiling. The sunlight that enters the cave make it iunsuitable for bats. Hinagdanan Cave was accidentally discovered when the area's owner was clearing decaying branches. He threw a stone into the hole and heard a splash. After building a ladder to enter the cave, be named it Hinagdanan. The cave is about 100 metres long, with many beautiful stalagmite and stalactite rock formations. There is a lagoon with a green hue produced by the green limestone at its bottom.</p>

            <p>Get on board a floating restaurant and enjoy the Loboc River cruise with buffet meal.
