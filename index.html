            <p>If you are going to Bohol for sightseeing and water activities, it's essential to take note of the climate, weather, and temperature before booking your plane tickets. In this section, you'll be able to know the best time of the year to visit Bohol. 

            Like most regions in the Philippines, the temperature in Bohol varies so little throughout the year. Bohol is hot all year-round. However, the chances of rainfall fluctuate throughout the year.

            So you will want to take note and avoid the months with high chances of precipitation, especially if you’re going to make the most out of the beaches and the water activities in Bohol. Additionally, knowing when peak seasons are will help you gauge the amount of crowd you can expect in Bohol tourist spots.</p>

            <p>Bohol is most iconic for The Chocolate Hills and its cute alien looking Tarsiers. The Chocolate Hills are an incredible landscape of cone shaped hills that are spread over 50km. If you’re lucky enough to visit while the sun is rising over the chocolate hills it is truly amazing! If you’re planning on visiting the Chocolate Hills be sure to also check out the Tarsiers as they are only 30 minutes away, making it the perfect day trip.

            <h2>Best time to go to Bohol</h2>
            <p>
                Like most regions in the Philippines, Bohol is hot year-round and sees little fluctuation in temperature. What matters more when planning a trip to Bohol is the amount of rainfall and knowing when peak seasons are.

                <br>
                June to November are the rainiest months so you may want to avoid that stretch if your goal is to catch as much sun as you can. Late December and Holy Week are peak seasons for locals so I’d say the best time to go would be from January to around Mid-March. The weather is ideal and there are fewer tourists.
                <br>
                DEC-MAR: High season in Bohol is from December till late March when it isn’t as hot (yet) and the weather is dry. Temperatures around this time range from 28-32°C (82-90°F) during the day and drop to 25°C (77°F) at night. As described, the period around Christmas and Holy Week are peak seasons for locals so be prepared to compete for the best real estate on the beach.
                <br>
                APR-JUL: If you’re allergic to people, then anytime after Easter weekend until July would be a good alternative. It’s hot, with temperatures rising to 38°C (100°F) during the day, but it also starts raining more so that may help to offset the scorching heat. Being summer, it’s also the best time to see the Chocolate Hills in their brown chocolate-y color.
                <br>
                AUG-NOV: August to November is considered the wet season so you may want to avoid this time as the rains become heavier and more frequent.
